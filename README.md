# Obsidian_Aeye


The magic of AI meets the flexibility of Obsidian! 🪄✨📓


## Overview


Welcome to the Aeye Plugin, where your images come to life with the power of AI! Have you ever gazed upon an image in your note and wished for words to leap out, painting its story, composing a poem, or even troubleshooting an error? Your wish is Aeye's command!


## Features


With Aeye Plugin, embedding images in your notes becomes a playground for creativity and problem-solving. Simply write a prompt like "describe what you see," "write a poem about this picture," or "troubleshoot this error" beneath any image in your note — and watch the magic unfold.


- **Contextual Image Descriptions:** Ever wanted a virtual bard to describe your scenic photos with eloquence? We've got you covered.

- **Poetic Muse:** Let Aeye be the silent poet behind your visual inspiration, crafting verses about the images in your notes.

- **Error Sleuthing:** Computer acting up again? Snap a pic of the error message, prompt Aeye, and get troubleshooting advice in plain text.


Just write your prompt text and invoke the command "Use Aeye with selected text as prompt" – voilà!


## Getting Started


Here's how to summon the AI genies:


1. Install Aeye Plugin from the Obsidian community plugins.

2. Navigate to Settings > Aeye Plugin and pour in your OpenAI API key essence (required to awaken the AI spirit).

3. Set your spell's power level by adjusting the maximum amount of tokens (choose wisely to preserve the AI's energy!).
