# Obsidian_Aeye


The magic of AI meets the flexibility of Obsidian! 🪄✨📓


## Overview


Welcome to the Aeye Plugin, where your images come to life with the power of AI! Have you ever gazed upon an image in your note and wished for words to leap out, painting its story, composing a poem, or even troubleshooting an error? Your wish is Aeye's command!


## Features


With Aeye Plugin, embedding images in your notes becomes a playground for creativity and problem-solving. Simply write a prompt like "describe what you see," "write a poem about this picture," or "troubleshoot this error" beneath any image in your note — and watch the magic unfold.
